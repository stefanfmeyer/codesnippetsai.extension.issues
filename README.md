### Built with GPT-4 & ChatGPT

We use GPT-4 & ChatGPT, which provides faster and more accurate responses to your questions, compared to GPT-3 or Codex.

### Installation

To use this extension, install it from the VSCode marketplace.

#### Get your API key

To use this extension, you will need an API key from your [dashboard](https://codesnippets.ai/).

To get one, follow these steps:

1. Go to [codesnippets.ai](https://codesnippets.ai/)
2. If you don't have an account, you will need to create one or sign up.
3. Sign up to the free trial.
4. Copy the API key from the dashboard and paste it into the Access Token field in the extension settings.
5. After completing these steps, the extension should be ready to use.

#### Why not use an OpenAI API key?

After asking the development community, we have found a few key points that influenced our decision to introduce a pricing model:

- ChatGPT Plus is expensive at $24/month.
- Using GPT-4 can lead to more expensive monthly cost for users, which averages over $30/month!
- Our GPT-4 PRO Plan is only $10/month and uses the same GPT-4 API as ChatGPT Plus.
- Code inserted into the Code Snippets AI extension is _NEVER_ read or used for training purposes.

### Usage

1. Open a file in Visual Studio Code and click on the CodeSnippets icon in the sidebar.
   - This will open the side panel with an input field.
2. Enter your prompt or question.
3. Click Enter.
   - The prompt will be sent to the AI.
   - The response will be displayed below the input field in the sidebar.

#### Add context to your request with selected code

Select some code in the editor, right click on it and choose one of the following commands from the context menu:

- AI -> Ask anything : Opens the custom command window for you to insert your own prompt. (You can also press Ctrl + Shift + A). With or without selected code for added prompt context.
- AI -> Add tests : Creates tests for the selected code.
- AI -> Find bugs : Looks for problems/errors in the selected code, fixes and explains them.
